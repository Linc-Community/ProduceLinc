# ProduceLinc Community Discussions

In this repository, you will find categories for various product areas. Feel free to share feedback, discuss topics with other community members, or ask questions.

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the ProduceLinc product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

## Discussions Categories

When creating a new post, make sure to choose the predetermined category that best fits your topic. This will ensure that conversations are indexed by their corresponding product or feature, to help community members quickly find answers to their questions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/ProduceLinc-Community/Roadmap/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We hope to foster productive and collaborative conversations.

Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already shared your suggestion(s). If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

### From a suggestion to a released feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the ProduceLinc product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities ProduceLinc doesnâ€™t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue and track its development in the [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ProduceLinc-Community/projects/3).
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
